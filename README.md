# Emotion-Detection
This Project aims to aid us in detecting emotions in a video.
It uses Python for both the Machine Learning Implementation and the User Interface Implementation.
The Libraries used here are:
*OpenCV - Used for Coputer Vision Processes Like Frame Extraction,Image Preprocessing which includes tasks like Resizing and Conversion to Grayscale for better clarity.
*Keras/TensorFlow - Used for deep learning model development, training and inference.
*Tkinter - Used for developing the User Interface.
*Matplotlib - Used to visualise the outputs.
